## Unprefix

Downvids allows you to download video, playlist or the whole Youtube channel which is awesome. My issue is that any video downloaded by this website, it is automatically given a prefix name of the website.
  * e.g. [WWW.DOWNVIDS.NET-What makes you special.mp4]

## Usage:
python unprefix.py --path C:\Users\TrustedSec\Downloads
